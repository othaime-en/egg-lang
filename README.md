# THE EGG PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE

This is a simple programming language implementation based on the guide from [Eloquent JavaScript Chapter 12](https://eloquentjavascript.net/12_language.html). The book provides a basic level implementation. I've managed to a add on a few more features.

## Features

- **Functions**: First-class functions with closures
- **Control Flow**: `if` conditionals and `while` loops
- **Variables**: Variable definition and assignment
- **Arrays**: Built-in array support
