# THE EGG PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE

This is a simple programming language implementation based on the guide from [Eloquent JavaScript Chapter 12](https://eloquentjavascript.net/12_language.html). The book provides a basic level implementation. I've managed to a add on a few more features.

## Features

- **Functions**: First-class functions with closures
- **Control Flow**: `if` conditionals and `while` loops
- **Variables**: Variable definition and assignment
- **Arrays**: Built-in array support

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 12 or higher)

### Setup Instructions

#### Option 1: Manual Setup

1. Create the project directory structure:

```
egg-language/
├── src/
├── examples/
└── tests/
```

2. Copy all the provided files into their respective directories
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd egg-language`

#### Option 2: Using Setup Scripts

**On Unix/Linux/macOS:**

```bash
# Make setup script executable and run it
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

**On Windows:**

```cmd
# Run the Windows setup script
setup.bat
```

### Example usage
